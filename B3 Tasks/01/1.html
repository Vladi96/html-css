								You are analyzing the monthly returns from a fund over the last year and calculate that the mean return was 1.25% with a sample standard deviation of 1.0%. You expected the fund to have achieved a return of 1.4% in line with the risk taken on by the fund and wish to decide at the 10% significance level whether the results are consistent with a population mean return of 1.4%. Given that t0.05,11= 1.796 you can conclude that:
