				<h2>The Seven Problems </h2>

				<ul class="list-problems">
					<li>
						<h3>Everyone is chasing the same set of leads.</h3>

						<p>Have you heard of H--overs?<br> Of course, they have a database with 40+ million contacts, and probably thousands of customers. <br>Now is it a good thing? These thousands of customers are essentially chasing the same pool of leads.<br> So if you are an IT executive with budget authority, how many canned pitches you think you get a day? 10? 20? How about 30+?<br>So clearly this doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>Generic sales pitches</h3>

						<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but most of sales pitches I see go something along the lines: &ldquo;Hey, IT executive! In case you need ______ , we are the best.&rdquo;</p>

						<p>This is not personalized and not contextual.  Hence, it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>Lots of marketing activity, yet no results</h3>
						
						<p>According to Pareto law, no more than 20% of your leads will turn into clients. If your sales funnel is a little bit complex, this number is actually lower &ndash; i.e. you lose 80% of leads at each step of your conversion funnel.</p>

						<p>Most of marketing activities that don&rsquo;t recognize the context to identify and exploit sales trigger events, spent (i.e. waste) inordinate amount of effort on leads who are obviously  in the &ldquo;never gonna happen&rdquo; pile. </p>

						<p>This leads to busy activity &ndash; emailing, social media&rsquo;ing, promoting &hellip; with no readily measurable results. No accountability.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3 >Marketing spent is not an investment but a liability</h3>
						
						<p>Here is the thinking&hellip; </p>

						<p>If I get pitched unskillfully by a certain person and company, I begin to transfer this negative impression onto this company&rsquo;s product or service, thus diminishing the future chances of my ever becoming their client</p>

						<p>In plain English: marketing and sales tools used incorrectly may not only NOT bring results, they can actually hurt your future sales.</p>
